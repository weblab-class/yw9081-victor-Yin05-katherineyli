# Beast Mode Information

## What is Beast Mode? 

Beast Mode is a fun, visual workout tracker. While traditional workout platforms focus on whole-body exercise frequency and duration, our website tracks the growth of each main muscle group---which is essential for people like Victor, who seems to only have arm days---via cute cat avatars. Moreover, by connecting to an external nutrition API to generate protein consumption information and documenting time-based atrophy, Beast Mode is multifaceted and accurate.
